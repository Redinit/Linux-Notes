# 🐧 Linux Notes — From Beginner to Pro

![Linux GIF](https://media1.tenor.com/m/y-cCxl8uEw0AAAAC/yetopen.gif)

Welcome to my **Linux Learning Notes Repository**!  
This repo documents my journey of mastering Linux for both **SOC (Blue Team)** and **Penetration Testing (Red Team)**.  
I’ll be covering everything from the fundamentals to advanced administration and security.

## 📖 About This Repository

This repository serves as my **personal Linux study notebook** — combining notes, commands, explanations, and practical tasks.  
It’s designed to help me understand how Linux works under the hood while building skills required for **SOC analysis**, **system hardening**, and **offensive security operations**.

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Build a strong foundation in Linux administration  
- Understand Linux internals (kernel, processes, permissions, etc.)  
- Use Linux effectively for SOC operations and security monitoring   
- Prepare for real-world cybersecurity and Red Team environments
